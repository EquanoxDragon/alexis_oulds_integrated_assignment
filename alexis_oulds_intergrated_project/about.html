        	<div id="content1"><p>Welcome to our about page, we are very glad to see people interested in learning what we're all about. So let's get started.<br><br> The main goal of this website was so that the artist commonly known as Equanox would have a place to put her art, and stories without using a third party host to allow others to view her work. She belives that adds, while okay when off to the side and not in ones face is fine, having them shoved down your throat when you're trying to enjoy a story can really destroy the flow of things. So with that in mind she wanted to make it possible for visitors to decide if they want to support her work or not rather than being forcefed adds just to keep things up and running. <br><br> So now you know why we made this, now how about getting to know the creator herself? <br><br> Equanox was born July 7th 2000, she's the eldest of two children and was born in Ontario Canada. She is bilingual in French and English, and has a passion for creating stories. Growing up she struggled academically and she still does, being diagnosed as having ADHD as well as Severe Generalised Anxiety Disorder, she was also diagnosed in grade 10 with Autism, but she wouldn't let that slow her down, instead using her way of thinking to excell in what she really enjoys, telling stories and making art. Her hopes are to one day be an animator or character design artists and concept artits.</p></div><!--end content1-->
